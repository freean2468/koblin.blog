I have developed applications last 9 years.
But I never had a moment to compile my knowledge and experience.
In this series, I will try to recap my knowledge and experience in computer science.

<h2 id="1">1. Network</h2>

These days with smartphones, we are always connected to the internet.
We use the internet to communicate, share information, and access services.
The internet is a vast network of computers that are connected to each other.
The internet is based on a set of protocols that define how data is transmitted over the network.
The most common protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

Before we begin, we should understand how the network consists of.

The network consists of several components:
- **Devices**: These are the physical components that make up the network, such as computers, routers, switches, and servers.
- **Links**: These are the physical connections between devices, such as cables, fiber optics, and wireless connections.
- **Protocols**: These are the rules that govern how data is transmitted over the network, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.
- **Services**: These are the applications that run on the network, such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer applications.

The network can be divided into several layers, each with its own set of protocols and services. The most common model used to describe the network is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which consists of seven layers:
1. **Physical Layer**: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices, such as cables and wireless connections.
2. **Data Link Layer**: This layer deals with the transmission of data over the physical connection, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
3. **Network Layer**: This layer deals with the routing of data between devices, such as IP (Internet Protocol).
4. **Transport Layer**: This layer deals with the reliable transmission of data between devices, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
5. **Session Layer**: This layer deals with the establishment, management, and termination of sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer**: This layer deals with the formatting and presentation of data, such as encryption and compression.
7. **Application Layer**: This layer deals with the applications that run on the network, such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer applications.

The OSI model is a theoretical model, and in practice, the TCP/IP model is more commonly used. The TCP/IP model consists of four layers:
1. **Link Layer**: This layer corresponds to the Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
2. **Internet Layer**: This layer corresponds to the Network layer of the OSI model and deals with the routing of data between devices using IP.
3. **Transport Layer**: This layer corresponds to the Transport layer of the OSI model and deals with the reliable transmission of data using TCP or the connectionless transmission using UDP.
4. **Application Layer**: This layer corresponds to the Session, Presentation, and Application layers of the OSI model and deals with the applications that run on the network, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

Now, let's take a look into a practical example of how we can view web pages using a web browser.

When you enter a URL in your web browser, the following steps occur:
1. **DNS Resolution**: The browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to resolve the domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address.
    - The process in detail is as follows:
        - The browser checks its local cache to see if it has the IP address for the domain.
        - If not, it sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name.
            
        - The DNS server looks up the domain name in its database and returns the corresponding IP address
        - The browser receives the IP address and stores it in its cache for future use.
