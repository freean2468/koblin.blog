I presume you are familiar with the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

In this post, I'll share how I apply TDD principles in my development process, focusing on back-end API development.

1. [The coverage determined by test code](#1)
2. [Struggle to anti-intuitive](#2)
3. [Mimic, mock](#3)
4. [Quality Control](#4)

Let's dive in!

<h2 id="1">1. The Coverage Determined by Test Code</h2>

When you begin typing the first line of code, it gradually expands into a function, 
a module, and eventually a complete feature. However, at this stage, 
it's unclear whether the module meets the new business requirements or where you should stop writing code.
>"Is this enough?" "Is this the right way to implement this feature?"

Beyond these concerns, additional worries arise:
> "What if I break an existing feature?"
> "What if I introduce a new bug, security vulnerability, performance issue?"
> "Do my APIs function as intended?"

The answer to these concerns is **test code**, and **TDD** is the most effective way to ensure you write it.

You write the test code first. But what test code?
The test code should cover the new business requirements.

For example, if you're implementing a new feature that allows users to upload a profile image, 
your test scenario would be:
```pseudocode
## business requirements : Users can upload a profile image.
START
  GIVEN a user uploads a profile image
  WHEN the image is uploaded
  THEN the image is saved to the server
  IF the image is not an image file
  THEN return an error message
END
```

You then transform this pseudocode into actual test code using the appropriate testing tools for your programming language or framework.

Following the TDD cycle:
1. Write the test code first and run it. The test will fail. (**Red**)
2. Write the actual implementation to make the test pass. (**Green**)
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability. (**Refactor**)

  alt="Red-Green-Refactor"
  width={600}
  height={465}
/>

This is the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle of TDD.

By following this cycle, you don't need to worry about how much code to write initially.
Instead, you determine how much test coverage is needed based on the business requirements.
If all test cases pass, you can be confident that the feature functions correctly.

As the codebase grows, these tests act as a safety net, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.
Without test coverage, modifying a large codebase becomes a risky endeavor.

<h2 id="2">2. Struggle Against Intuition</h2>

One of the biggest challenges with TDD is that it feels counterintuitive at first.

**Writing test code before actual implementation is not natural.**

Most developers instinctively want to start coding the main logic fist rather than writing test cases. However, skipping test-first development often leads to regret
and uncertainty about whether the code truly works as expected.

To overcome this, I have made writing test code first a habit. Like any habit, 
it requires practice and discipline, but the long-term benefits of well-tested, maintainable code make the effort worthwhile.

<h2 id="3">3. Mimic and Mock.</h2>

While writing test codes, you would encounter situations where your code depends on external systems.
However, testing those dependencies directly can be difficult for several reasons:
- The dependent system is not yet implemented.
- The dependent system is unavailable in the test environment.
- Test shouldn't have impact to the actual system.

To handle this, we use mimicking and mocking techniques.

<h3 id="mimic">(1) Mimic</h3>
Mimicking means creating a simplified version of a real object that behaves in a similar way. 
It’s often a manually implemented fake version of a dependency.
ex. A fake database that mimics the real database’s behavior but stores data in memory instead.

<h3 id="mock">(2) Mock</h3>
Mocking means a dynamically creating object that replaces a dependency and allows you to verify how it was used.
ex. Mocking a function call to ensure it was invoked.

By mimicking or mocking dependencies, you can effectively isolate the code under test and ensure reliable, efficient testing.

<h2 id="4">4. Quality Control</h2>

Quality Control(QC) ensures that software meets predefined standards before it reaches production.

By using test-driven development, I ensure code quality, especially for APIs, before they are integrated with the front-end.
APIs should be verified at the back-end level first, reducing potential issues down the line.

Additionally, as the codebase grows, test coverage continues to act as a safety net, preventing regressions and ensuring consistent quality.

## Conclusion

In this post, I shared how I apply TDD principles in my development process.

- Writing test cases before implementation ensures proper coverage.
- Overcoming the struggle of writing tests first requires practice and discipline.
- Mimicking and mocking dependencies help isolate test cases.
- Test coverage provides long-term quality control for growing codebases.

Happy coding with TDD!
