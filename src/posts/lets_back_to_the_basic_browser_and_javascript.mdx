<h2 id="1">1. Browser</h2>

<h3 id="1-1">What is a browser?</h3>
A browser is a software application that allows users to access and navigate the internet.
It interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages and provides a user interface for interaction.

<h3 id="1-2">How does a browser work?</h3>
A browser works by sending requests to web servers, retrieving resources, and rendering them for display.
When a user enters a URL, the browser performs the following steps:
1. **DNS Resolution**: Converts the domain name into an IP address.
2. **HTTP Request**: Sends an HTTP request to the server at that IP address.
3. **Response Handling**: Receives the server's response, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.
4. **Rendering**: Parses the HTML and CSS to create the Document Object Model (DOM) and the CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
5. **JavaScript Execution**: Executes any JavaScript code, which can manipulate the DOM and CSSOM.
6. **Painting**: Renders the visual representation of the page on the screen.

What if user interface takes a long time to proceed?
Then the browser will be blocked and the user will not be able to interact with it.
To prevent this, modern browsers adopt a hybrid architecture that combines both multi-processing and multi-threading.
- Each browser tab or site is usually managed in a separate **process**, improving security and crash isolation.
- Within each process, especially the renderer, multiple **threads** handle different tasks such as rendering, painting, compositing, and running scripts.

This separation of concerns ensures better performance, responsiveness, and reliability for modern web experiences.

<h3 id='1-3'>All processe list of a browser</h3>
- **Main Process**: Handles the browser's UI, manages tabs/windows, and coordinates between other processes.
- **Renderer Process**: Renders the web page, parses HTML/CSS, runs JavaScript, builds DOM/CSSOM, performs layout and painting.
- **Network Process**: Manages network I/O like DNS resolution, HTTP requests/responses, and caching.
- **GPU Process**: Handles hardware-accelerated graphics tasks (e.g., compositing layers, WebGL).
- **Utility/Extension Process**: Handles tasks like audio, PDF viewer, or browser extensions (depending on the use case).

And also each of these processes can have multiple threads to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.

<h3 id='1-4'>Threads in a browser</h3>
- **Main Thread** :	Executes JavaScript, handles DOM, user events, layout & painting.
- **Compositor Thread** : Combines layers and manages smooth scrolling/animations.
- **Raster Thread(s)** : Converts vector graphics to pixels.
- **Worker Threads** : Run background tasks like Web Workers, Service Workers.
- **I/O Thread** : Handles file, network, or IPC tasks (in certain processes).

<h3 id='1-5'>What if a browser sends an HTTP request?</h3>
Let's imagine inside the Renderer Process, your JavaScript does this:

```javascript
const response = fetch('/api/data');
const text = response.text(); // Synchronous? UI freezes!
```
This would block the Renderer’s main thread, which:
- Handles user input (clicks, typing)
- Executes JS
- Triggers layout and paint
- Updates DOM

Even though the network fetching is done in a separate process,
waiting for the result synchronously in the renderer’s thread means:
- No repainting,
- No user interaction,
- The tab freezes until the response returns.

In contrast, if you use asynchronous fetching:

```javascript
fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(text => {
    // Update DOM without blocking the UI
  });
```

This allows the browser to continue processing user input, rendering updates, and other tasks while waiting for the network response.
To enable this, browsers use a **message-passing** mechanism between processes and threads.

<h3 id='1-6'>Message Passing in Browsers</h3>
Browsers use a message-passing system to communicate between different processes and threads. This allows them to maintain responsiveness and isolate tasks. Key concepts include:
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**: Mechanism for processes to communicate, often using messages or events.
- **Event Loop**:
  - Each process has its own event loop that handles events, messages, and tasks.
  - The main thread processes events from the event loop, allowing it to remain responsive.

<h3 id='1-7'>Event Loop in Browsers</h3>

The event loop is a core part of the browser's architecture, allowing it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. It works as follows:
1. **Task Queue**: When an asynchronous operation (like a network request) completes, it places a callback in the task queue.
2. **Event Loop Cycle**: The event loop continuously checks the task queue for pending tasks.
3. **Execution**: When the main thread is idle, it picks tasks from the queue and executes them, allowing the browser to remain responsive.

<h3 id='1-8'>Callback, Promise, and async/await</h3>

Callbacks, Promises, and async/await are mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript:
- **Callback**: A function passed as an argument to another function, executed after the operation completes.
- **Promise**: An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, allowing chaining of `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.
- **async/await**: Syntactic sugar built on Promises, allowing asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous style. An `async` function returns a Promise, and `await` pauses execution until the Promise resolves.

<h3 id='1-9'>Browser Rendering Pipeline</h3>
The browser rendering pipeline is the sequence of steps a browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a visual representation of a web page. The main stages include:
1. **Parsing**: The browser parses HTML to create the DOM and CSS to create the CSSOM.
2. **DOM Construction**: The DOM represents the structure of the web page, while the CSSOM represents the styles.
3. **Render Tree Creation**: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to create a render tree, which contains only the visible elements of the page.
4. **Layout**: The browser calculates the size and position of each element in the render tree, determining how they will be displayed on the screen.
5. **Painting**: The browser paints the pixels on the screen based on the layout, converting the render tree into a visual representation.

Browser engines like Blink (used in Chrome and Edge) and Gecko (used in Firefox) implement this pipeline.

<h2 id="2">2. Javascript</h2>

Javascript has been a core part of web development since its inception. 
It was followed by the browser's development, which needed asynchronous capabilities to handle user interactions and dynamic content updates.
JavaScript's event-driven nature and non-blocking I/O model came from this need, allowing developers to create responsive web applications.

<h3 id="2-1">EcmaScript</h3>

ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript, providing a consistent specification for implementing the language across different environments.
It defines the syntax, semantics, and features of JavaScript, ensuring compatibility and interoperability among various browsers and platforms.
ECMAScript versions are released annually, introducing new features and improvements to the language.
For example, ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) was a significant update that introduced features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and promises, enhancing JavaScript's capabilities for modern web development.

<h3 id="2-2">JavaScript Engines</h3>

JavaScript engines are the core components of browsers that execute JavaScript code. They parse, compile, and execute JavaScript, converting it into machine code for the host environment.
Popular JavaScript engines include:
- **V8**: Developed by Google, used in Chrome and Node.js.
- **SpiderMonkey**: Developed by Mozilla, used in Firefox.
- **JavaScriptCore**: Developed by Apple, used in Safari.
- **Chakra**: Developed by Microsoft, used in older versions of Edge.
These engines optimize JavaScript execution through techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, garbage collection, and inline caching, improving performance and responsiveness a the renderer process.

<h3 id="2-3">JavaScript in Browsers</h3>

JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web browsers, enabling dynamic content, interactivity, and asynchronous operations. 
Browsers provide APIs like the DOM API, Fetch API, and WebSocket API, allowing developers to interact with the browser and perform tasks like DOM manipulation, network communication, and real-time data exchange.
JavaScript's integration with HTML and CSS enables the creation of rich, interactive user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience on the web.

<h3 id="2-4">TypeScript</h3>

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.
It allows developers to catch type-related errors at compile time, improving code quality and maintainability.
In the javascript, compile time errors are not caught until runtime, which can lead to bugs that are difficult to trace.
TypeScript's type system enables better tooling support, such as autocompletion, refactoring, and code navigation, making development more efficient.
TypeScript also supports modern JavaScript features and provides additional features like interfaces, enums, and generics, allowing for more robust code organization and design patterns.


TypeScript compiles down to standard JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing browsers and environments.
It is widely used in modern web development, especially in large-scale applications, due to its ability to provide better tooling, code organization, and type safety.
