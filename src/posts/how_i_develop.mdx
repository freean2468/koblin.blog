title: "How I develop : A 6-Year Web Developer’s Perspective"
date: "2024-Nov-18"
description: "How I approach development"
tags: ["development approach"]
---
As of November 2024, I have reached my 6th year as an web developer in my professional career.

Over this time, moving from a startup to other startup, I’ve developed a structured approach to tackling projects in a team environment. 
From understanding business requirements to final production releases, this post shares my development process step-by-step, emphasizing collaboration, efficiency, and maintainability.

The process I follow typically includes the following steps:

1. [Understanding business requirements](#1)
2. [Writing down development design documents](#2)
3. [Refining Specifications with Other Players](#3)
4. [Writing test code using TDD principles](#4)
5. [Preparing documentation for front-end developers](#5)
6. [QA](#6)
7. [Release](#7)

Let's begin.

<h2 id="1">1. Understanding Business Requirements</h2>

The first step in any development process is to understand the business requirements.  
Most of the time, these requirements are provided by the project manager (PM), who has already aligned with the stakeholders to define them.  
Occasionally, they may come in a raw form, such as through verbal communication with board members or other key decision-makers.

To address these requirements, we hold a project kickoff meeting.  
During the meeting, I carefully analyze the business requirements, considering the best solutions from a technical perspective.  
I also share my opinions on:
- **Approaches**: How we should tackle the requirements.  
- **Considerations**: Potential factors to address before starting the project.  
- **Interdependencies**: Whether a chosen approach might create issues for other parts of the system.

Another key aspect of the meeting is **time estimation**.  
We evaluate how long the project will take and share this estimate with the PM, enabling them to plan the project timeline effectively.

<h2 id="2">2. Writing Development Design Documents</h2>

Before writing a single line of code, I draft development design documents.  
These documents detail the:
- **Tech stack**: Tools and technologies required for the project.  
- **Implementation plan**: How the tools will be utilized to achieve the desired outcomes.  
- **Edge cases**: Anticipated exceptional scenarios and how to handle them.  

This step helps me outline the entire development process, anticipate challenges, and prepare solutions.  
By sharing these documents with the team, we encourage feedback that can enhance the project’s quality even before development begins.

  <figcaption className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
    <p style={{"marginTop":"0px", "marginBottom":"0px"}}>Example: Development Design Document Index</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>


The documents often include **data modeling** and **API specifications**, which are critical for understanding and aligning technical workflows.

  />
  <figcaption className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
    <p style={{"marginTop":"0px", "marginBottom":"0px"}}>Example: Modeling and API Specification</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>


By creating and refining these documents, the team ensures that everyone is aligned, which significantly improves the project’s foundation and efficiency**.**

<h2 id="3">3.Refining Specifications with Other Players.</h2>

As a back-end developer (though I consider myself full-stack capable), I collaborate closely with front-end developers to ensure the technical aspects align with design and user experience requirements.  
During the early stages of workflow, I verify that the **API specifications** and **data modeling** align with front-end requirements.  

I often view front-end developers as the "customers" of my APIs.  
Therefore, I prioritize ensuring that:
- The API is **well-verified** before use.  
- The API is **intuitive** to implement.

In this process, I share my thoughts on API design and adjust the specifications based on feedback from the front-end team.

---

<h2 id="4">4. Writing Test Code Using TDD Principles</h2>

To ensure the API works as expected, I write test code following the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.
This process ensures the API functions correctly and that future changes do not break the existing codebase.

One well-known TDD strategy is **Red-Green-Refactor**:
1. **Red**: Write a failing test.  
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code required to pass the test.  
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize the code while maintaining functionality.

  alt="Red-Green-Refactor"

/>

Though writing test code before actual implementation feels counterintuitive, it is highly effective for maintaining a robust and maintainable codebase.  
While I don’t strictly adhere to TDD, I always keep its purpose in mind to write effective test code.

<h2 id="5">5. Preparing Documentation for Front-end Developers</h2>

Once the API is verified with test code, I prepare comprehensive documentation for front-end developers to enable efficient integration.  

This documentation typically includes:
- **API Details**: Endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling guidelines.
- **Project-Specific Notes**: Additional details tailored to the project.    
<img

  alt="api detail"

- **Swagger Documentation**: Auto-generated with detail data structures from the very working codebase.

  alt="swagger document"

Good documentation ensures that front-end developers can seamlessly integrate the API without confusion or delays.

<h2 id="6">6. QA</h2>

Quality assurance (QA) is a critical step in the development process.  
In this phase, the entire team collaborates to test whether the project meets business requirements and functions as expected.

If issues arise, the team reports them, and an assigner addresses them promptly.  
<img
  src="/posts/how_i_dev/qa.png"
  alt="issue cards"
  width={647}
  height={219}/>
The QA phase ensures that the project is stable and ready for release to the production environment.


---


<h2 id="7">7. Release</h2>

The final step is releasing the project to the production environment, where real customers can use the service.  

The release process varies depending on the project and company policies. However, it is crucial to ensure that:
- The project works as expected in the production environment.  
- Additional post-release tests are conducted to verify functionality.

## Conclusion

In this post, I shared how I approach development in a company environment, focusing on processes and collaboration.  
While there are many methodologies and strategies for project development, I believe the most important aspects are ensuring the project works as expected and maintaining its long-term maintainability.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
Even with six years of experience in the industry, I still see myself as a learner.
I welcome any feedback or suggestions you might have — they help me grow and improve.
