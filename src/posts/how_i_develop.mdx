As of November 2024, I have reached my sixth year as a professional web developer.
During this time, I've worked across startups, honing my ability to tackle complex projects in collaborative environments.

This post offers a step-by-step overview of my development process, emphasizing efficiency, collaboration, and maintainability, from understanding requirements to final production releases.

The process I follow typically includes the following steps:

1. [Understanding business requirements](#1)
2. [Writing down development design documents](#2)
3. [Refining specifications with collaborators](#3)
4. [Writing test code using TDD principles](#4)
5. [Preparing documentation for front-end developers](#5)
6. [Quality assurance (QA)](#6)
7. [Release](#7)

Let's dive in!

<h2 id="1">1. Understanding Business Requirements</h2>

The first step in any development process is to understand the **business requirements**.  
These requirements are typically provided by the project manager (PM), who aligns with stakeholders before presenting them.  
Occasionally, they come in raw form, such as during verbal discussions with board members or key decision-makers.

To address these requirements effectively, we hold a **preliminary meeting** to analyze and discuss:

- **Feasibility**: Can we implement these requirements with current technologies?  
- **Workflows**: What’s the best approach for implementation? 
- **Challenges**: What obstacles might arise, and how can we address them?  

Another key focus of this meeting is **time estimation**.  
By assessing the effort required, we provide realistic timelines to the PM, helping them plan the project schedule accurately.

<h2 id="2">2. Writing Development Design Documents</h2>

Before diving into code, I prepare **development design documents** that outline the project’s technical foundation. These documents include:

- **Tech stack**: The tools and technologies we’ll use.
- **System architecture**: How do we structure the entire system to privide the service. 
- **Data modeling**: How the data is structured and stored. 
- **API specifications**: How the API will be designed and implemented.
- **Edge cases**: Anticipated exceptional scenarios and how to handle them.  

This step allows me to anticipate challenges, propose solutions, and gather team feedback to enhance the project’s quality.

<h2 id="3">3.Refining Specifications with Collaborators.</h2>

As a back-end developer, I collaborate closely with front-end developers to ensure the **technical aspects** align with design and user experience requirements.  

I view front-end developers as the "customers" of my APIs.  
Therefore, I prioritize making APIs that are:
- **Well-verified**: Fully tested before use.  
- **Intuitive**: Easy to integrate and use.

During this phase, I also adjust specifications based on feedback from the front-end team, ensuring seamless collaboration.

<h2 id="4">4. Writing Test Code Using TDD Principles</h2>

To maintain high reliability, I follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles when building APIs.  
This involves the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test.  
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code required to pass the test.  
3. **Refactor**: Optimize the code while maintaining functionality.

While I don’t strictly adhere to TDD in every case, its principles guide me in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code.

<h2 id="5">5. Preparing Documentation for Front-end Developers</h2>

Once APIs are verified, I prepare comprehensive documentation to streamline front-end development.  
This documentation includes:

- **API Details**: Endpoints, request/response formats, and error-handling guidelines.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Auto-generated from the codebase for consistency.

Good documentation ensures smooth integration and minimizes confusion for the front-end team.


---

<h2 id="6">6. Quality Assurance (QA)</h2>

QA is a collaborative phase where the team ensures the project meets business requirements and functions as expected. 
Issues identified during this phase are promptly addressed and retested to ensure stability.


---


<h2 id="7">7. Release</h2>

The final step is releasing the project to the production environment.  
After deployment, we conduct additional **post-release tests** to ensure everything works as expected for real users.

## Conclusion

This post provides a high-level overview of my back-end development process, focusing on collaboration and maintainability. 
While there are countless methodologies and strategies, I believe the most important aspects are delivering results that meet business needs and ensuring long-term maintainability.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
Even after six years of experience, I still consider myself a learner and welcome any feedback or suggestions you might have.
