Business often get lost what their users want therefore the team struggles with defining requirements in a way that is clear, user-focused, and actionable.
This is where user stories come in.

<h2 id="1">1. What is a User Story</h2>

A user story is a simple, structured way to describe what a user needs from a system.
It helps teams understand **who** the user is, **what** they want to achieve, and **why** it matters.

For example, in the traveler IT sector, a user story could be:
> As a tour supplier, I want to be able to advertise my tour packages so that I can reach more customers.

Like the example above, a user story has a format:
> As a [user role], I want [action or feature], so that [goal or benefit].

This structure ensures clarity and user-centricity while allowing team members to understand the purpose behind each feature.
So the user story provides a guide where the product should go and why.
And with it, whole team can be on the same page about what they are building and why so that the product could be delivered to users successfully.

<h2 id="2">2. Why User Stories Are Important</h2>

1. **User-Centric Focus** - All product should be user-centric. User stories help teams understand the user's needs, goals, and motivations, which is essential for building a product that users will love.
2. **Better Collaboration** - Product managers, developers, and designers can easily align on what needs to be built.
3. **Faster Iterations** - Stories are small, allowing for quick development and feedback loops.
4. **Improved Prioritization** - Teams can prioritize work based on what provides the most value to users.

<h2 id="3">3. [Acceptance Criteria Follwing User Stories</h2>

With user stories, team members can look a way the same direction. 
But how do we sure a product the team is building is on the right track?

This is where acceptance criteria comes in.

Acceptance criteria(AC) is a set of conditions that a product must meet to be considered complete under a user story.
For example,
> As a tour supplier, I want to be able to advertise my tour packages so that I can reach more customers.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - The tour supplier can create a new tour package.
  - The tour package is displayed on the website.
  - The tour package can be shared on social media.

With AC, the below benefits can be achieved:
1. **Clarifies requirements** - Prevents ambiguity by specifying what "done" means.
2. **Guides development** - Helps developers understand the expected behavior of the feature.
3. **Enables testing** - Provides clear pass/fail conditions for QA testing.
4. **Improves collaboration** - Ensures alignment between stakeholders, developers, and testers.

<h2 id="5">4. What Is a Good User Story</h2>

A well-created user story follows the INVEST criteria:
1. **Independent** - Can be developed without dependency on other stories.
2. **Negotiable** - Open for discussion and refinement.
3. **Valuable** - Provides value to the user.
4. **Estimable** - Can be estimated in terms of effort.
5. **Small** - Fits within a sprint.
6. **Testable** - Has clear acceptance criteria.

Example:
- Bad story:
> As a tour supplier, I want to provide great travel experience. (Too vague, not testable)
- Good story:
> As a tour supplier, I want to get a review from customers so that I can improve my services. (Specific, testable)

## Conclusion

User stories are a powerful tool for aligning teams around user needs and ensuring that products are built with a clear purpose.
But they are not a silver bullet.
If user stories are consuming too much time, or if they are not used properly, they can become a burden rather than a help.
