I'm sure you've experienced situations where a well-written document saved you.
Maybe it was a guide written by a previous developer or even something you wrote for yourself and forgot about.
Regardless, in those moments, documentation proved to be invaluable.

At first glance, documentation might seem like an unnecessary chore--especially when you're eager to jump straight into coding.
However, over time, I've realized that it plays a crucial role not just in software development but also in operating a company effectively.

In this post, I'll share why I document and how I document to improve productivity and streamline processes.

<h2 id="1">1. The Moments When I Needed Documents</h2>

Here's a true sentence, **"Memory is unreliable."**.

When you're working on a project, you constantly learn new things, make decisions, and solve problems.
Meanwhile, the memories you worked on wiped out as time goes by.

>"Oh, I've done this before. How did I solve this problem? I can't remember."
>"How did I set up this environment? I can't remember."
>"What was the reason for this decision? I can't remember."
>"Did I implement this feature? I can't remember."
and so on.

There are countless moments when you need to recall past experiences, decisions, or solutions.
In those moments, well-organized documents can save you time and effort like below.

>"Oh, I wrote a document about this. Let me check it."
>"The previous developer left a guide for this. Let me check it."
>"We decided based on this document. Let me check it."

In these moments, documentation becomes a valuable asset, providing clarity and guidance when you need it most.

<h2 id="2">2. How I Started Documenting</h2>

The company I working on has strict working process.
>"We don't start project without documents." 
>"We don't release without documents."

Overall, the company's policy is to document everything, from project requirements to development design, implementation, and release notes.
Without documentation, the project is considered incomplete. So all of members of the project are required to write documents.

I was inexperienced in documenting at first, so I found it challenging to write documents about the project such as main logic, minimum requirements, architecture and so on...
However, as I continued to write documents, I realized that it helped me understand the project better and communicate more effectively with my team members.

Furthermore, the documents bring all the team members to the same page, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project's goals, requirements, and implementation details.
So the outcome of the project is more predictable and the project is more likely to succeed.

<h2 id="3">3. Documents That Required to Deliver A Product to Users </h2>

Here are documents that I met in the company to deliver a product to users.:
1. **User Stories**: Describing user needs, features, and requirements from the user's perspective to guide product development and ensure user-centric design.
2. **Roadmaps**: Outlining the project's long-term goals, milestones, and timelines to align team members on the project's direction.
3. **Process Maps**: Visualizing workflows, tasks, and interactions to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization.
4. **Checklists**: Providing a list of tasks to complete for specific processes, such as deployment, testing, or code reviews.
5. **Coding Standards**: Defining coding conventions, best practices, and guidelines for consistent code quality.
6. **Development Design Documents**: Outlining the project's technical foundation, including tech stack, system architecture, data modeling, API specifications, and edge cases.
7. **Architecture Diagrams**: Visualizing the system's components, interactions, and dependencies to aid in understanding and troubleshooting.
8. **API Documentation**: Detailing how to use the API, including endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes.
9. **Meeting Minutes**: Documenting key decisions, action items, and discussions from team meetings to ensure accountability and follow-up.
10. **Release Notes**: Summarizing the changes in each release, including new features, bug fixes, and known issues.
11. **Onboarding Guides**: Helping new team members get up to speed quickly by providing an overview of the project, tools, and processes.
12. **User Manuals**: Explaining how to use the software, including setup, configuration, and common tasks.

As you can see, the document list is not limited to the development sector.
To deliver a successful product, we have to focus on what users need. 
Each document plays a crucial role in ensuring that the project meets user needs, aligns with business goals, maintains high quality and delivers the product to the end-user.

## Conclusion

In this post, I shared why I document and how I stated documenting and the documents that required to deliver a product to users.
I find the documentation is essential process to work with team members to deliver a successful product to end-users.
I hope you share the same thoughts and have the positive effect from the documentation.
